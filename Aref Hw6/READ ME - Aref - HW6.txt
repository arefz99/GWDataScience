NOTES: When I run this code for more than 10-15 cities I get a syntax error – can show you if you’d like. So I just ran it for 10 cities. Observable trends based on these 10 cities – very minimal data so these may not be true when run for 500 cities: Higher latitudes: - Are more cloudy than lower lats- Directly increased humidity as we go closer to the poles- The further away we get from the equator in either direction the temperature drops (closer to the poles the lower the temp)- Wind speed seems to be higher when closer to the equator
